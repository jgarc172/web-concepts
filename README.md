creating a web application from the simplest concepts

Lessons on the different subjects that makeup the web.  The goal is to 
progressively create a simple web page, then a website, then a web application.

The web page for the example would be a resume web page that can be used as part of your Github site and can 
be referenced from other sites such as Linkedin.
