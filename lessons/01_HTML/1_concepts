# The Simplest HTML page

## Concepts

The tool we will be using is a web browser.

**web browser**

A web browser, when given a valid HTML document, *renders* the HTML page.

**HTML document**

Based on the fact that the simplest web network requires at a minimum one client (browser) and one server, 
see if you can answer these questions:

1. Where is this HTML document created?
2. How is this HTML document created?
3. Who creates it?

These are actually very difficult questions, and it is very important that you know 
how to answer these, because this is what you will be doing in your real job.

_answers_:

1. In the server
2. HTML pages can be created 

    a. in advance.  These are called Static pages
    
    b. at request time. These are called dynamic pages and are typically associated with the term *web application*
    
3. Based on the type, HTML pages are created by 

    a. static: a frontend developer and a graphics designer
    
    b. dynamic: a frontend developer, a graphics designer, and a backend developer
