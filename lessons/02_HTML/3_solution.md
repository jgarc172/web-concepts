## My Solution

my solution is in file [simpleWithData.html](https://github.com/jgarc172/web-concepts/blob/master/lessons/02_HTML/simpleWithData.html)

## Review

The identified HTML file is equivalent to the contents of the file.

**identifiers**:  

    file:///C:/data/training/html/simpleWithData.html
    
    this is the identifier of a file when given to the browser.
    
    or
    
    https://github.com/jgarc172/web-concepts/blob/master/lessons/01_HTML/simpleWithData.html
    
    this is the identifier of the same file from the github server given to the browser. 
    It contains HTML data but it is not  rendered by an HTML renderer.  
    The contents of the data are rendered (interpreted) as text.
                
**values**:   
    
    The contents of the <body> with <p> elements
    
    or

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Simple HTML</title>
      </head>
      <body>
    
      </body>
    </html>
    
**Representations or types**:   

    HTML, text

**transfer**:

    The contents of the file simple.html, the <body> element, was copied to the browser's window
