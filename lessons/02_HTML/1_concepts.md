# HTML and Data

## Concepts

An HTML document with data.

Here is how data in an HTML is presented, using a simple paragraph `<p>` elements:

    . . .
    <body>
      <p> data 1 </p>      
      <p> data 2 </p>    
    </body>
    . . .

**Data**

We know that an HTML document originates in the server.  The data in the HTML also originates in the server. 

See if you can answer these questions:

1. How is the data merged into the HTML document?
2. Who creates it?


_answers_:

1. Data is merged into an HTML page . . . 

    a. In advanced by **hardcoding** the data into the HTML document.  Static pages
    
    b. at request time, by executing a backend program that build both the HTML and data line by line, or
      by merging a pre-built HTML template with the data.
    
3. Based on the type, HTML and Data are merged 

    a. static: a frontend developer and a graphics designer
    
    b. dynamic: a frontend developer, a graphics designer, and a backend developer
