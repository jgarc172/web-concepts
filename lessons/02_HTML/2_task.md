## **Problem or Goal**

We want to render an HTML page that contains data.

## Available tools

We'll use the local filesystem to create the HTML document.
We'll use simple examples of data, for example, two simple paragraphs of text:

    This is paragraph 1
    
    This is paragraph 2


## A Simple Solution

One can create an HTML document that contains data in the `<body>` element.  The two paragraphs of text are enclosed each in a `<p>` element.


		HTML doc with data ------>  Browser ----> rendered data in HTML
				

**identifier**:       The name of the file

**value**:          The contents of the `<body>` with `<p>` elements

**representation or type**: HTML rendering by the browser


## Task and Implementation

Create a file named "simpleWithData.html" and save it in your filesystem.  Implement the solution by using your 
favorite text editor and create a valid HTML document with the following two text segments rendered as paragraphs.  

    This is paragraph 1
    
    This is paragraph 2


## Test 
 
Using the browser, **identify** the HTML file to open the file and render it in the browser.  You must see the two paragrapsh 
in the browser.  Use the Developer tools console in Chrome (Ctrl + Shift + J) to check for any  errors.  

You can also use this website to validate the form of your HTML page:
